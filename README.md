This Number guessing game is part of an ice task done in Mobile App Scripting,the purpose of this app was to ensure it generates a random number and gives the user a text saying whether it is 'too high' or 'too low'.

**Design of the Game:**

* The game was designed to be easy to use and easy to navigate.
* It was is designed purely off of the pseudocode written in assignment one of IPRG5112.
* The game would let the user know how far they are from the answer.
* The number of attempts the user ,uses to find the answer will be displayed at the bottom of the input screen.
* the reset button is displayed once the user found the number allowing them to play another round.

**Group Reflection:**

Working in a group was very helpful because in many places where one was confused ,another would help find a solution for the problem.working together was a delight and helped build a stronger work ethic as we would both be motivated to push forward and finish the task at hand.

**Application Features:**

* A button had been put at the bottom of the input screen for the user to click on once a number had been typed in.
* the user would receive a short message once they found the mystery number with an "ok" button for them to go back to the screen.
* The reset button would be used to reset the game so the user can replay the game.
